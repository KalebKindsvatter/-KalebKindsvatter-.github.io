        <h2>Growing Up</h2>

        <p>I grew up in East Lansing, MI. When my dad retired in 2014 we moved up to our cabin in Indain River, MI full time. I attended Petoskey Schools and played sports for them as well. I started racing snowmobiles at 4 years old and continued to race after the move. I retired from racing at the age of 16. I am very thankful for that experience because it allowed me to be mechanically inclined my whole life.</p>

        <p>I grew up with many allergies and asthma, they were a pretty big part of my life. When I was very little all I could eat was water and rice. By the age of 12 I as able to finally be able to drink milk and eggs but no nuts. I am still allergic to nuts. I could still play sports but I had to have my rescue inhaler close by incase my asthma acted up.</p>

        <h2>Present</h2>

        <p>Right now I am finishing up my time at Alma College. I am in the 3-2 program and in the fall I will be attending Ferris State. My family just got a new dog as well and her name is Willow</p>

        <p>It looks like I will be having a very busy summer. Some of the things I have to do is work, attend one of my best friends bachelor party, host a family reunion, go camping at least twice, clean up our 10 acres on Beaver Island, celebrate my 21st birthday, and football camp at Ferris State. </p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
